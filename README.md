# VR_KartRace_XRtoolkit
 This is a VR kart racing game based on the Mix and Jam tutorial for creating a drifting car controller in Unity: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ki-tWT50cEQ     I then modified the script to work with VR input as well as adding a horn to the kart and multiplayer support using Photon.
